#Checklist

##Calculator Class

- Check typo **Calculator**
- Semantic:
  + A calculator includes a list of products: doesn't make sense at all
  + `Calculator.new(calculator).calculator` doesn't make sense too

- method `calculator` is complicated
- why use @result, @products variable instead of local variables

**Suggest to improved**

- Focus more on the OOP principle
- Make the method simpler (7 lines per method)
- Khoa suggest follow this model to write code, My can use it like a reference, checkout branch tax-patch-1
